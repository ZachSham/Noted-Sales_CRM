# Noted – Sales CRM

Hi, my name is **Zach Shamieh**. I’m a student at **UCLA** with an interest in **Sales Engineering** and **Solutions Consulting**.  

I built this CRM to practice full-stack development and to have a project that connects directly to my career goals. My cousin, an **Account Executive at Oracle NetSuite**, suggested features he and other sales reps would find useful, and they tested the app during development.  

The project runs on **port 5050** for the backend API and is served to the frontend at **http://3.141.106.235:3000/**.

## Implementation
- Built with **Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS**  
- Deployed with **Docker** on **AWS EC2**  
- Single-container setup where Express serves both the API and the React build  
- Connected to **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud database storage

## Features
- **Client Management** – Add, view, update, and delete client records  
- **Task Management** – Create tasks with due dates tied to clients or general workflow  
- **Meeting Tracking** – Schedule and view meetings linked to clients  
- **AI Note Summaries** – Generate meeting note summaries and suggested follow-ups (powered by OpenAI)
